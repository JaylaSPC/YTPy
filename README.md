# YTPy
A simple Youtube video downloader  
Made in 2 hours  

What I learned:
- How to use Pytube
- How to use comboboxes in customtkinter
- How to use threading

What I would change/add/improve:
- Re-encode mp4 files into mp3 files with ffmpeg (Currently only changes the file extension)
- I would like to make the code look cleaner
- Make a new class for the downloader
